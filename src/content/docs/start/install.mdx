Please make sure your device meets the minimal requirements. You can check the "Compatible Devices" tab on the sidebar for more information.

## 2. Installing

### Android 🐸

Just open the apk and click install.

### iOS 🍎

Since iOS does not want you to easily sideload apps, and I don't have spare $99/yr to pay Apple for a certificate, you'll have to do some work to install it.

**Prerequisites**

- A free apple account
- A computer (Windows / macOS)

There are many ways to sideload apps: TrollStore, AltStore/SideStore, and Sideloadly.

- **TrollStore** only work on iOS 14.0 beta 2 - 16.6.1, 16.7 RC (20H18), and 17.0, but it works very well when it does work. Apps are permanently signed in TrollStore while other options need to be refreshed every week. If your iOS version is supported, definitely try TrollStore first.
- **AltStore/SideStore** has a better-looking UI and is more convenient to refresh apps.
    - AltStore uses LAN network, while SideStore connects through a VPN
- **Sideloadly** is more advanced and direct, has more features, but less convenient.

**Option 1: AltStore / SideStore**

1. Follow the guide on [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) / [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/) to install the store on your iOS device.
2. Download KanadeDX.ipa on your iOS device
3. Open the ipa in AltStore/SideStore to install it

**Option 2: Sideloadly**

1. Follow the guide on [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) to install the ipa from your computer.

Note that the sideloaded app is only valid for 7 days, so you will have to connect to your computer again to refresh the app every week.
